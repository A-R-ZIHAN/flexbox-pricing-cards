Tried to turn a pricing card template into HTML Css using Flexbox. Turns out it's a successful.
I didn't keep the middle card because the color combination didn't look good. And of course, finding the right gradient color is hard. For now, focusing on colors won't be my work.

Template that I copied: https://www.uplabs.com/posts/pricing-cards-mockup
